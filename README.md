# ubase - suckless Linux base utils

ubase is a collection of tools similar in spirit to util-linux but much simpler.

The complement of ubase is [sbase](http://git.suckless.org/sbase/), which mostly follows POSIX and provides all the portable tools. Together they are intended to form a base system similar to BusyBox but much smaller and suckless.

## Building

To build ubase, simply type:

```sh
make
